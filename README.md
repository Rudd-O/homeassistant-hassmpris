This integration allows you to control your media player applications
(VLC, Chromium, Amarok) from Home Assistant.  This is being published
as a HACS custom component until the [review](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/77188)
for the official integration within Home Assistant is approved.

Documentation for this integration is available
[here](https://github.com/Rudd-O/home-assistant.io/blob/4b9081cbdfc196575b4174cae09710d2fda1ffbb/source/_integrations/hassmpris.markdown).
